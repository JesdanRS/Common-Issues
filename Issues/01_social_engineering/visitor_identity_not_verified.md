### Visitor Identity not Verified
The Dionach consultant was accepted into the {==OFFICE==} building as an unannounced visitor and {==OFFICE==} building security provided a building pass to give access to the {==CLIENT==} offices. Suitable checks were not made to verify the consultant's identity and backstory before they were granted access to {==CLIENT==}'s offices.
#### Impact: Medium
An attacker gaining access to the offices without verification may be able to perform a number of actions such as stealing sensitive information, accessing restricted areas within the office and using computer systems.
#### Likelihood: Medium
It is possible for an attacker to obtain a {==OFFICE==} building pass without a pre-arranged appointment by simply conjuring a fictitious scenario. However an attacker would need to be motivated to target {==CLIENT==} in this manner.
#### Recommendation
Ensure that {==CLIENT==} staff always challenge visitors about their reasons of being in attendance, especially on occasions where nothing is known about the visitor and their purported visit purpose.
