### Insufficient Sign Out Process
When physical social engineering attempts were carried out, Dionach consultant was not expressively asked by {==CLIENT==} building security to give back the visitor badge received when they entered the facilities. Visitor badge could have been copied and re-used as part of other social engineering attacks. Please note that the consultant voluntarily provided the building pass to {==CLIENT==} employees on completion of the debrief meeting.
#### Impact: Medium
Visitor badges can be stolen, copied and used again as part of other social engineering attacks. {==OPTION==}Additionally, {==CLIENT==} building passes are valid for a whole day meaning an attacker could come and go as they please throughout the authorised period.
#### Likelihood: Medium
Although visitor badges can be easily stolen, an attacker would require a valid scenario to obtain an initial access to the facility.
#### Recommendation
{==CLIENT==} should review the current visitor pass issuing process to create procedures and install security controls to ensure that visitor badges are returned.
