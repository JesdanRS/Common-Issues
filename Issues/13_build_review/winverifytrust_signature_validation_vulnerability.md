### WinVerifyTrust Signature Validation Vulnerability
The affected system{s were|| was} seen to be missing registry keys that are required to mitigate a weakness in portable executable (PE) verification known as WinVerifyTrust signature validation vulnerability (CVE-2013-3900). If present, the registry keys enforce additional Windows security features that help prevent execution of malware. Please see the following URL for more information:

[https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2013-3900]()
#### Impact: High
An attacker could inject malicious code or tamper with executables signed with a trusted certificate to bypass controls preventing execution of untrusted applications.
#### Likelihood: Low
An element of social engineering would be required in order to convince a user to open a malicious file, either delivered by email or by convincing the user into downloading a file from a website.
#### Recommendation
Consider enabling strict Windows Authenticode signature verification for PE files by creating "EnableCertPaddingCheck" DWORD registry entries with a value of "1" in the following registry locations:

```
HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Cryptography\Wintrust\Config\
HKLM\Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Cryptography\Wintrust\Config\
```

Note that a restart is required for changes to take effect.
