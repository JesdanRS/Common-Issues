### Wireless Controller Firmware is Outdated
The {==VENDOR==} wireless LAN controllers are running firmware versions {==FIRMWARE==}, while the latest available firmware is {==LATEST==}.

The installed version may be vulnerable to:
```
{==DESCRIPTION_CVE_AND_URL==}
{==DESCRIPTION_CVE_AND_URL==}
```
#### Impact: Medium
{==EXAMPLE1==} The firmware updates primarily address stability and reliability issues with the wireless controllers, however, the latest updates also address privately disclosed security flaws in the controllers' user interfaces.

{==EXAMPLE2==} An attacker can potentially alter wireless controller configuration in order to attempt to intercept, read or hijack traffic, and to target systems attached to the wireless networks.
#### Likelihood: Low
{==OPTION==} Lack of wireless network stability may cause availability issues, but there is little likelihood of this being used to support deliberate compromise of {==CLIENTNAME==} systems or data.
{==ALTERNATIVE_EXAMPLE==} Details of the vulnerability and a proof of concept exploit have not been publicly disclosed for the configuration modification attack.
#### Recommendation
Update the wireless LAN controller software to the most recent stable version. See the following URL for software updates for WLAN controllers:

{==URL==}

Review policies and procedures to ensure that devices are updated within a timely manner to protect against newly discovered threats.
