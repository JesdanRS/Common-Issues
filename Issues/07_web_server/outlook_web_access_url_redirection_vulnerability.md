### Outlook Web Access URL Redirection Vulnerability
A vulnerability in Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA) allows attackers to redirect the user to an arbitrary URL when the login button is pressed. A user could be tricked into clicking a specially crafted URL and be redirected to a page that appears to be their OWA login page. The user credentials could then be captured and the user returned to their own server without them knowing.

The link below demonstrates this by redirecting OWA users to the Dionach website after inputting their credentials.

#### Impact: High
Users' credentials could be captured without them realising. As domain usernames and passwords are used to access OWA, this could lead to further compromise of other systems.
#### Likelihood: Low
Although this issue is straightforward to abuse, an element of social engineering would be required.
#### Recommendation
There is currently no patch available for this issue for Exchange 2003; the risk can be mitigated by alerting users not to click on any URLs when accessing the Outlook Web Access web pages but to enter the URL manually instead. Note that Exchange 2007 is not vulnerable to this issue.
