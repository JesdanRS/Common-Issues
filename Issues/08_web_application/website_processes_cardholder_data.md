### Website Processes Cardholder Data
The affected website{s||} allow{s||} users to pay for {==items==} using credit or debit cards. {==OPTION==} The user submits their full card details, including the security code (CV2) to the website{s||}, which then passes these details on to the payment gateway. This would allow an attacker who compromises the website{s||} to directly steal cardholder details, either by modifying the payment processing script, or if the details are stored in the database. These actions would not be visible to the user. {==OPTION==} Although the card details are not sent to the website{s||}, the form that the user enters these details into is generated by the website{s||}. This would allow an attacker who compromises the website{s||} to steal the card details, for example by inserting malicious JavaScript into the checkout form.

#### Impact: Medium
An attacker compromising the website{s||} may be able to modify the checkout pages, allowing them to steal cardholder data from customers who checkout. This could result in financial penalties for {==CLIENTNAME==}, as well as reputational damage if the breach was publicised. The presence of cardholder data also greatly increases the amount of work required for the site to be compliant with PCI DSS.
#### Likelihood: Medium
An attacker would need to compromise the website{s||} in order to obtain cardholder data; however its presence greatly increase the attractiveness of the website{s||} as a target due to the financial incentive to compromise it.
#### Recommendation
Wherever possible, process payments using either an IFRAME to a payment gateway, or by redirecting the visitor to the payment gateway website, so that no cardholder data is ever sent to or from the server. Note that any redirection should be done using the payment gateway's security features, such as signing the transaction or using a secure hash, in order to prevent payment tampering.
