### Domain Expiring Soon
Ownership of the domain{s below|| DOMAIN} will expire within 6 months{:||, on DATE.}

{==DOMAINS==}
#### Impact: Medium
If the ownership of the domain{s are|| is} not renewed, then {they||it} could be purchased by a third party, who would then have complete control over {them||it}. This would result in unavailability of any websites using the domain{s||}, and could also lead to extra expense of having to buy the domain from the third party; or legal costs for trying to reclaim it. Additionally, the third-party would receive any email intended for the domain{s||}.
#### Likelihood: Low
Most registrars will notify domain owners when their domain is up for renewal, and some will auto-renew domains without manual intervention. An attacker would have to be motivated to target {==CLIENTNAME==} in this manner and the domain registrar may implement a Redemption Grace Period (RGP).
#### Recommendation
Ensure that the domains are renewed prior to the expiry date.
