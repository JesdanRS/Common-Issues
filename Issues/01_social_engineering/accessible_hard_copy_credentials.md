### Accessible Hard Copy Credentials
The login credentials for {||one} {==CLIENTNAME==} system{s||} {were||was} found to be written on a piece of paper at {==CLIENTADDRESS==}, as shown below:

{==PHOTOGRAPH==}
#### Impact: High
Anyone with physical access to the office can easily obtain the credentials and potentially gain unauthorised access to restricted information or resources.
#### Likelihood: Medium
Anyone who has physical access to {==CLIENTNAME==} {==office==} could identify the credentials including staff, cleaners and visitors.
#### Recommendation
Ensure that staff are aware of {==CLIENTNAME==} policies with regards to password management and how to handle confidential and sensitive data. Also, consider advising staff to use a safe and secure mechanism for storing passwords, such as using password management applications. This could be achieved through regular security awareness and training programme. One possible password management solution is KeePass 2 available at the following address:
