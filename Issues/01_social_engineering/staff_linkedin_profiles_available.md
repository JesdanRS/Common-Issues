### Staff LinkedIn Profiles Available
Some {==CLIENTNAME==} staff have publicly accessible profiles on the social networking website "LinkedIn", which can be obtained with a crafted search engine query, such as that shown below:

```
site:linkedin.com "{==CLIENTNAME==}"
```

While no obviously sensitive information is exposed, these profiles present a wealth of information about organisations and their staff, and as such are often harvested by attackers preparing for a social engineering attack. An example of the profiles exposed is shown below:

{==URL + TRIMMED SCREENSHOT==}
#### Impact: Low
Information of potential use to an attacker planning a social engineering attack is revealed.
#### Likelihood: Medium
Searching well-known social networking sites, public forums and the use of carefully crafted search engine requests are common methods of information gathering prior to launching an attack against an organisation or website.
#### Recommendation
Ensure that all staff are aware that any information posted about themselves or {==CLIENTNAME==} on social networking websites can quickly become publicly available, and as such should be appropriately sanitised.
