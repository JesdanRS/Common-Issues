### SSL/TLS Renegotiation Denial of Service Vulnerability
The affected website{s||} {have|has} a flaw in the way that SSL or TLS renegotiation handshakes are handled. This is because the web server{s||} {do|does} not limit the number of renegotiations a client can issue for a SSL/TLS connection. An attacker can issue several simultaneous connections to the server and attempt to simultaneously renegotiate these connections. This will cause the web server to perform a large amount of computational processing, which could prevent the server{s||} from responding to new requests or even crash the server and cause a denial of service.

This issue is discussed further in the following article:

[https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2011-1473]()
#### Impact: Medium
An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability could prevent the web server{s||} from processing new requests and cause a denial of service.
#### Likelihood: Medium
Proof of concept scripts targeting this vulnerability are freely available online. The attacker would need to be motivated to target the website in this way.
#### Recommendation
Update the web server{s||} with the latest security patches. On the web server{s||}, disable client initiated renegotiations. Consult the web server's documentation for further information. Note that this may impact service availability for some customers.
