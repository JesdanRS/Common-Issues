### Image Only CAPTCHA in Use
The CAPTCHA on the website at {==URL==} is image based, and does not provide an alternate option for people who are visually impaired. This puts {==CLIENTNAME==} potentially in violation of accessibility legislation by excluding visually impaired users from using the website. It may also dissuade some visitors from accessing the website.
#### Impact: Medium
This could result in legal and financial consequences for {==CLIENTNAME==} if a lawsuit is brought against them for discrimination, as well as damage to the organisation's reputation.
#### Likelihood: Low
It is unlikely that legal action would be brought against {==CLIENTNAME==}; however, accessibility concerns are very important for many users.
#### Recommendation
Provide an alternate CAPTCHA system for visually impaired users, such as an audio message. Google's reCAPTCHA software provides this option. Please visit the following link for further information:
