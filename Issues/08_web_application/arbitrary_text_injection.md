### Arbitrary Text Injection
{The affected websites allow||The affected website allows} arbitrary text to be submitted to the application through the URL, which is then reflected in the web server response. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability by crafting a link, such as the one below, with their own message. The resulting text would appear as if it was generated by the trusted application, and not by the attacker.

{== URL with custom message visible (URL + phone number) ==}

Please note that an attacker could mask the above crafted link, for example as a hyperlink:

{== URL with custom message embedded ==}
#### Impact: Medium
An attacker could exploit this issue to harvest user sensitive information by means of social engineering, or to trick users into installing malicious software onto their computers.
#### Likelihood: Low
Identifying and exploiting this vulnerability is straightforward, however, an element of social engineering would be required for this attack to succeed. In addition, as clickable links cannot be injected onto the page, a victim would have to perform additional actions, such as {==calling the provided number or copying and pasting the URL to visit the malicious website==}.
#### Recommendation
Ensure that user supplied information is not reflected in the page. {==OPTION==} Consider displaying error messages based on unique identifiers, such as GUID, which are appropriately validated using server-side scripts.
