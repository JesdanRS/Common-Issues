{==SCREENSHOT==}
#### Impact: Medium
No further updates for this operating system will be provided, and the software will become increasingly vulnerable to attack as time progresses. There are a number of remotely exploitable vulnerabilities in Windows XP for which exploit code is publicly available.
#### Likelihood: High
Obsolete software is typically less stable than actively supported software, as well as being a particularly desirable target for attack.
#### Recommendation
Consider upgrading to a later operating system as soon as possible. The following link from NCSC provides short-term mitigation guidelines for organisations unable to migrate from obsolete software in time:

Please also note that many legacy applications will require specific operating system configuration changes to be made before they can be made to run successfully on the latest supported versions of Windows.
