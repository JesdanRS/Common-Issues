  Be mindful with impact/likelihood as they are context-depentdent. You need to determine which file types are permitted, why that matters for the target environment, who can access them and how.
  
  Binaries, scripts, container formats (tar, zip, gz, etc.), or other file types that are executable by default on common platforms (or within the specific target environment) will probably make the impact high.
  
  Being able to upload documents commonly used to target users (pdf, docm, xlsm, etc.) probably makes the impact high.
  
  Being able to upload a text-based file (e.g. EICAR.txt) probably makes the impact medium/low.

### Uploaded Files Not Scanned for Malware
Files uploaded via the affected system{s||} did not appear to be scanned for malicious content, which could then be accessed by {==other website users/an administrator==}.

During testing it was possible to upload {==an EICAR file, which contains a special signature agreed upon by antivirus vendors and is treated by antivirus programs as if it were a real virus. Further information regarding the EICAR test file is available at the following URL:

[https://www.eicar.org/download-anti-malware-testfile/]()==}

The uploaded {==EICAR file==} was then available from the URL below.

{==URL and screenshot==}
#### Impact: High
Any {==ROLE==} user can upload malicious files which may then be downloaded and executed by {==other website users/an administrator==}. This could allow an attacker to infect and compromise {==other users/administrators==} and their computers.
#### Likelihood: Low
The victim would to download and execute the malicious file. {==Uploaded files are available unauthenticated.==} Malicious files may be quarantined by local antivirus on users' systems.
