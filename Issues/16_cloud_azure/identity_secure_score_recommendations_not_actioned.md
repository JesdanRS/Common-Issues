{==SCREENSHOT==}
#### Impact: Medium
These suggestions resolve potential security issues related to the respective resource, and together help to provide a defence in depth approach that greatly reduces both the likelihood and the impact of a {==CLIENTNAME==} systems compromise.
#### Likelihood: Low
Although issues are reported with a number of resources, in many cases an attacker would need authenticated access to the Azure portal in order to exploit the current configurations settings.
#### Recommendation
Review the Identity Secure Score recommendations and determine which settings are relevant and should be applied to the organisation's resources. Note that some of the recommendations may not be compatible with, or applicable to, currently deployed resources.
