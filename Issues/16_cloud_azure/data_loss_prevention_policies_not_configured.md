A review of Microsoft 365 Compliance Centre revealed that Data Loss Prevention (DLP) was not in use and there were no DLP policies configured:

#### Impact: Medium
Sensitive information could be accessed by or shared with unauthorised users. This could impact the confidentiality of sensitive information and potentially result in legal or reputational implications.
#### Likelihood: Medium
When technical controls are not implemented, users are more likely to make mistakes such as sending information to wrong recipients.
#### Recommendation
Implement strict and rigorous DLP policies that are in line with the current organisation's data classification and handling guidelines. Further information can be found at the following URL:
