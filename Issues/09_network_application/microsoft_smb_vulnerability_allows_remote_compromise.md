### Microsoft SMB Vulnerability Allows Remote Compromise
The following system{s||} {are||is} running "{||an}" unpatched version{s||} of Windows which {are||is} affected by the well-known vulnerability MS08-067. This would allow an attacker to compromise the system{s||} through remote code execution.

{==IP ADDRESSES==}

The following proof of concept demonstrates how an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to take control of an internal system.

{==SCREENSHOT==}
#### Impact: High
An attacker exploiting this vulnerability would have complete control of the host. This could allow them to install a keylogger, dump cached credentials, or assume the permissions of any user logging in to that host. This access could then be leveraged to perform further attacks against the domain.
#### Likelihood: High
This vulnerability is publicly listed and exploits are publicly available in commercial and free exploit platforms such as the Metasploit Framework.
#### Recommendation
Ensure that all systems are connected to {==WSUS==} to provide centrally managed updates and that all key security related patches are applied. Note that installing the latest security patches may cause compatibility or stability problems, so ensure that all data is backed up and there is a rollback or failover plan before installation.
