### Previously Connected Peripherals Vulnerable To Keystroke Injection
Automated scanning of the laptop{s suggested that they|| suggested that it} had previously had a wireless {==Microsoft==} keyboard connected, which allowed keystrokes to be injected. This vulnerability is known as MouseJack.

Please note that this issue was identified based on the recorded details of previously connected USB devices. As such, it was not possible to determine the date the vulnerable device was connected. The details of the device are shown below:

#### Impact: Medium
Where vulnerable peripherals are used, an attacker could potentially intercept or inject keystrokes, which would allow them to perform actions on the system or obtain sensitive information.
#### Likelihood: Low
An attacker would need to be physically proximate to the victim, and a vulnerable device would have to be connected at the time.
#### Recommendation
When security vulnerabilities are announced, ensure that processes are in place to install firmware updates for existing and newly purchased peripherals.
